## GitHub Pages

This repository is published to GitHub Pages at:

- https://simply-Rahul8.github.io/RVS/

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site and deploys the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch automatically on pushes to `main`.

Quick verification:

```powershell
# fetch the latest gh-pages branch
git fetch origin gh-pages
git log origin/gh-pages -1 --pretty=oneline
```

If you want the repository README to instead show a short project overview, or to add build/deploy instructions specific to this repo, I can edit the README further — tell me what you'd like shown.
